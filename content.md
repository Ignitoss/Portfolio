### About

I am a new web designer/developer eager(excited) to learn and grow amoung professionals. I have a bachelors degree in marketing and merchandising and through various positions and hobbies found a passion in all things computers.

Recently discovering a fascination for coding when(while) ..., I decided to pursue a career in programming.

I have had a rising interest in coding since my first role in a networking position and recently decided to invest in myself and dive full into a career in programming.

I have had a rising interest in coding since building my first computer after college. I have since taken roles in networking and engineering and found I love the chellenge of debugging problems and seeing tangible results from those solutions. I enjoy creating something that is useful for other people and the endless learning that accompanies an always improving industry.

Currently I am aiming to cultivate my skillset as a front-end developer with a long-term goal to explore back-end programming to have a deep understanding on both sides of the profession. As such I am seeking a junior developer position to kickstart my career.
